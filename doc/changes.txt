  * Began fleshing out the interface for lgp::Object.
  * Began to flesh out lgp::GameSystem.
  * Created doc/GameSystemNotes.txt to brain storm about game system requirements.
  * Made a slight edit to objects.dia to reprent the name chosen for lgp::ObjectBase.

1 April 2011
  * Created initial files for lgp_object.cpp and lgp_object.hpp
  * deleted lgp_objectbase.cpp.  The implementation file is not needed for a fully abstract class.
    the constructor and destructor are easily defined inline, as they are simply empty return statements.

  * This file generated.
  * libgamepieces Project restarted using the random numbers code and exceptions code from the previous project as a starting point.
  * Made a few spelling corrections in the doxygen formatted comments.
  * looked over lgp::Random.  It looks sufficient for the moment.  It is simplistic, but it does not have to be complex.
    If it is decided later that some function is being done repeatedly, then I may add functionality to lgp::Random.
  * lgp::DiceBag looks ok for now as well.  If new features are needed, they will be added.
  * lgp::DiceStack and associated code is not currently 100% a part of the project, but it should be safe, and it may be of
    use later, so I am leaving it in the tree, and will occasionally work on it. Others are free to play with it as well.
    I am not counting it against progress at this time though.
  * Created the initial files for lgp::ObjectBase.
